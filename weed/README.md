http://priceofweed.com. 

@amitkaps has a [repository](https://github.com/amitkaps/weed) with nice csv files and jupyter notebooks. [@frankbi](https://github.com/frankbi/price-of-weed) wrote a script to pull the data every day from the website, but it does not look like it has pulled in two years. 

[Here](http://hiphoff.com/price-of-weed/) is a blog post that made some interesting graphs with the data.
