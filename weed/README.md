data and microscope on weed prices in America

# Data 

http://priceofweed.com. amitkaps has a [repository](https://github.com/amitkaps/weed) with a bunch of scripts and links to nice csv files. [frankbi](https://github.com/frankbi/price-of-weed) wrote a script to pull the data every day from the website, but it does not look like it has pulled in two years. 

[Here](http://hiphoff.com/price-of-weed/) is a blog post that made some interesting graphs with the data.

The website invites emails from researchers interested in their data. I wrote them last night (9/13). No reponse yet. 

# Research questions

Weed comes in low, medium and high quality. Is there a lemons market somehwere?
